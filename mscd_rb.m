% Input
%   - adj: adjacency matrix
%   - ps : list of gamma values to consider (from high to low)
%
% Output
%   - coms: community (crip) membership per node
%   - Qs  : criterion values of the corresponding partitions
%
% Comments:
% - This implementation uses Reichardt and Bornholdt's criterion. The code
% specific to it is placed between comment signs lines and can be replaced
% with code optimising any other criterion. It was placed within the
% algorithm and not in external functions for speed optimisation purposes
% only.
